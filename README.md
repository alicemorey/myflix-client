Project Overview:

myflix client is a web application that provide users with access to information about different
movies, directors, and genres. 
Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.

This client-side app is built using React, based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

Technical Requirements:

● The application must be a single-page application (SPA) 

● The application must use state routing to navigate between views and share URLs 

● The application must give users the option to filter movies using a “search” feature

● The application must use Parcel as its build tool 

● The application must be written using the React library and in ES2015+ 

● The application must use Bootstrap as a UI library for styling and responsiveness

● The application must contain function components 

● The application must be hosted online 

● The application may use React Redux for state management of at least one feature (i.e., filtering movies)
